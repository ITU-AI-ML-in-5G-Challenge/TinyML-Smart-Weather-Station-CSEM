# Preprocess data
This folder aims to extract and process the dataset from the recorded data to the dataset feeded into the machine learning model. It is organised as follow :
- `constants.py` : it contains all the constants the user has to define to run the extraction process : name of pcm, date of recording, location of recordings and the location where to store the resulted data
- `convert_pcm.py` : convert the recordings acquired by the MAX78000 in .pcm format to a pandas dataframe where a given row contains the bme sensor data, and to .wav files for the audio recording
- `extract_data.py` : after having run the convert_pcm_to_pickle.py file, this python file will handle all the process of extracting the micro:bit data and the files generated by the previous python file, to merge them together, filter the invalid data and to store for each hour a pandas dataframe where each entry consists of the audio recording, the bme sensor data, and the wind/rain value at this time
- `preprocess.py` : after converted and extracted the data, this file will handle all the preprocessing(normalization, resampling, lowpass, mfcc, ...) to get a dataset that can be fed to a machine learning models
- `tools.py` : contains all the utils functions for analysis purposes, such as plotting the audio file or getting the audio metrics
- `data_analysis.ipynb` : contains all the analysis made to the data

To get the final preprocessed dataset, first define all the constants in constants.py, then run convert_pcm, extract_data and preprocess in this order.
